      "taskId": 2,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Data Models",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 8,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of each model class (McpRequest, McpResponse, McpError, IntacctQueryRequest, IntacctQueryResponse, OAuth2Token) into separate subtasks for class definition, validation logic, and JSON serialization/deserialization. Add subtasks for writing unit tests for each model and for integration testing of serialization/deserialization across all models.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves designing multiple interrelated data models, implementing validation, and ensuring robust JSON serialization/deserialization. While each model is conceptually straightforward, the breadth of models and the need for thorough testing and validation increase the overall complexity. The task is already partially decomposed, but further splitting by implementation concern (fields, validation, serialization, testing) will improve clarity and parallelization."

    {
      "taskId": 3,
      "taskTitle": "Implement OAuth2 Authentication Module",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 10,
      "expansionPrompt": "Decompose the task into subtasks for Spring Security OAuth2 client configuration, OAuth2TokenService implementation (acquisition, storage, refresh, validation), OAuth2RequestInterceptor creation, in-memory token store methods, OAuth2 client property configuration, token refresh scheduling, and comprehensive unit/integration testing for each component.",
      "reasoning": "This module requires integrating with external authentication systems, managing token lifecycle, handling concurrency, and ensuring secure storage and refresh of tokens. The need for robust error handling, scheduling, and integration with Spring Security increases both technical and architectural complexity."

      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Intacct REST Client",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 8,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for WebClient setup, request/response codec configuration, OAuth2 interceptor integration, method implementation (executeQuery, validateConnection), response parsing, error handling, connection pool and retry policy configuration, and comprehensive testing (unit, integration, error scenarios).",
      "reasoning": "Building a robust REST client involves handling network errors, authentication, response parsing, and retries. The integration with OAuth2 and the need for detailed error handling and logging add to the complexity, though the task is focused on a single API client."

      "taskTitle": "Implement MCP Protocol Handlers",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 9,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks for StdioMcpHandler implementation, SseMcpHandler implementation, McpTransportManager abstraction, JSON serialization/deserialization, heartbeat mechanism, error handling, streaming response support, concurrent request handling, and comprehensive testing for each transport.",
      "reasoning": "Supporting multiple transports (stdio, SSE), streaming, and robust error handling requires careful design. The need to abstract transport details and ensure concurrency and reliability increases the complexity beyond a typical handler implementation."

      "complexityScore": 8,

      "expansionPrompt": "Decompose into subtasks for Spring AI integration, prompt template design, AI response parsing, schema and constraint validation, fallback mechanism implementation, caching, logging, performance benchmarking, and comprehensive testing with mock and real-world queries.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves integrating AI services, designing effective prompts, parsing and validating AI output, and ensuring reliability and performance. The inherent unpredictability of AI responses and the need for robust validation and fallback mechanisms make this a high-complexity task."

      "complexityScore": 9,

      "expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for service registration, request parsing, method routing, handler implementation for each MCP method, streaming response logic, context tracking, timeout handling, metrics collection, error propagation, and comprehensive end-to-end and concurrency testing.",
      "reasoning": "This is the core orchestration service, coordinating multiple components, handling streaming, timeouts, metrics, and error propagation. The need for robust, concurrent, and reliable processing across diverse scenarios makes this the most complex task."

      "expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks for global exception handler implementation, error code/category definition, structured logging configuration, request/response logging with PII redaction, correlation ID management, ErrorResponseFactory creation, circuit breaker integration, and comprehensive testing for each error scenario.",
      "reasoning": "Implementing a comprehensive error handling and logging framework requires careful design to ensure clarity, security, and maintainability. The need for structured logging, PII redaction, and circuit breaker integration adds to the complexity."

      "expansionPrompt": "Decompose into subtasks for configuration class implementation, configuration source support (env, CLI, file), startup sequence logic, transport detection, graceful shutdown handling, health check implementation, and startup banner/version info.",
      "reasoning": "While foundational, this task involves standard patterns for configuration and startup logic. The need to support multiple configuration sources and ensure graceful startup/shutdown adds moderate complexity."

      "reasoning": "This task is largely procedural and follows established patterns for Java/Spring Boot projects. While important, it is less complex than core development tasks and can be efficiently handled with standard tooling."
